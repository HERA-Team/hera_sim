# `hera_sim`: Simple simulation package


Basic simulation package for HERA-like redundant interferometric 
arrays. 

For a tutorial and overview of available features, check out the 
Jupyter notebook: `docs/tutorials/hera_sim tour.ipynb`.

## Installation

We have tried to make `hera_sim` as easy to install as possible, however it depends
on a few packages which can give some problems. Because of this, a simple 
``pip`` install will **not** work on a clean environment. This may be remedied in the 
future.

### Conda users
If you are using conda, the following command will install all dependencies which it
can handle natively:

``$ conda install -c conda-forge numpy scipy pyuvdata aipy=3.0.0rc2 mpi4py attrs h5py healpy pyyaml``

If you are creating a new development environment, consider using the included environment
file:

``$ conda env create -f travis-environment.yml``

This will create a fresh environment with all required dependencies, as well as those
required for testing. If you also would like to compile the documentation, use

``$ pip install -r docs/requirements.txt``

Finally, install `hera_sim` with

``$ pip install [-e] .``


### Pip-only install
If you are not going to use conda, then you must follow the following process (the reason
that this is not a one-step process is because some of the packages inadvertantly require
other packages to be installed before they can even be installed, let alone used, and ``pip``
reads the ``setup.py`` file for each package before installing anything).

First install the basic dependencies:

``$ pip install numpy scipy h5py scikit-learn mpi4py``

Then install the following:

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/HERA-Team/uvtools.git
$ pip install pyuvdata
$ pip install pyuvsim
```

Then to install this repo, either download and run ``pip install -e .`` or
run 

``pip install git+git://github.com/HERA-Team/hera_sim``.
